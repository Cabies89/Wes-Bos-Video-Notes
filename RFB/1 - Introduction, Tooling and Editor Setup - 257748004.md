# Introduction, Tooling and Editor Setup

The React Devtools extension has been updated since the recording of the course and is no longer named `React` in the Browser devtools.

It is now split into two separate Browser Devtool Tabs named `Components` and `Profiler`. You will be using `Components` for the course.

You should note that the Devtool Tabs won't show up in the course project until you start to write React code that will happen in a few lessons. You can test that it does work by going to an existing React.js website such as `https://instagram.com` and it will show in the Browser devtools.

The devtools also got a UI upgrade and looks differently from the videos. The React devtools no longer show the individual `<div>` elements but only the React Components. If you want the `expanded view` similar to how it looks in the course then you can delete the default `component filter` from the React devtools.
