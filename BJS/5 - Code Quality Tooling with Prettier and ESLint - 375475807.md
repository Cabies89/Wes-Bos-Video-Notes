# Code Quality Tooling with Prettier and ESLint

Please note that for ESLint to work you need to open the correct folder directly in your code editor, it will be the folder where you installed the `ESLint` npm packages and where you created the `.eslintrc` config file.

Opening a parent folder or child folder in your code editor will cause ESLint to fail in finding the ESLint npm packages and the formatting won't work.

```sh
your-username
  |
  projects
    |
    beginner-javascript # <- Open this folder directly in your code editor
      .eslintrc
      package.json
      node_modules/
      exercises/
      playground/
```
