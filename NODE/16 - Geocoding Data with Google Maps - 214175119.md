# Geocoding Data with Google Maps

*Do not use the `Google Maps API Key` that is included in the course files as it is no longer valid.*

You need to create your own Google Maps API key for the course. Once you have your own Google Maps API key you need to replace the default key that is provided in the `variables.env` file that you created at the start of the course. The ENV variable you need to update is named `MAP_KEY`.

The 3 API's you need to enable on your Google Maps API key are `Maps JavaScript API`, `Places API` and `Maps Static API`.

*Also note, make sure that billing has been enabled on your Google account - by adding a credit card or any other accepted payment method - or else the API key won't work*.

Google provides $200 worth of free credit per month so you won't be charged for using it in a course. The documentation on how to create your own Google Maps API key is here. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
